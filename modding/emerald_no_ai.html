    Interally refered to as "Pokemon Emerald No AI," this was my first project I worked on with my friend <a href="https://atsignarchives.wordpress.com/">AtSign</a> for youtubers SmallAnt and PokemonChallenges.

    The mod requires mGBA due to the connectivity between the games. You can <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/178LUxoOANTDBejGAIL6orSBhByF3M9rb">download the mod here</a>.

    I primarilly focused on making the connection between the games stable and creating packages to communicate information, both in the overworld and in battle.

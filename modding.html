    I make Pokemon mods for twitch streamers sometimes. If you would like to comission me, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and we can get in touch. Most of the money I make from this is being put towards saving for when I become a broke graduate student, so rest assured it's for a good cause. Pricing may vary but if I take an interest in your project and you're a smaller creator I will be fine taking a bit of lower pay so it remains affordable.

    Alternatively, if you're looking to start modding yourself, feel free to <a href="contact.html">message me over discord</a> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/pret">PRET repositories on GitHub</a>, and I can help find a good starting point based on your goals. You can also check out my decompilation guide (WIP) for how to get started translating assembly into c for any game!

    I'm most well known for my <a href="/modding/map_randomizer.html">Heart Gold and Soul Silver Map Randomizer</a>, but I also have a large body of work you can check out here. Most of my mods are based on the generation 4 <a href="https://github.com/pret">PRET repositories</a>, which I'm both contribute to and maintain.

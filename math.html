    I graduated from University of Michigan as a math major in 2025. I plan on persuing a PhD in combinatorial math. Most of the practical math I do involved algorithm development, like my first ever Pokemon mod, the <a href="/modding/map_randomizer.html">Heart Gold and Soul Silver Map Randomizer,</a> which makes heavy use of graph theory to make for a fun experience.

    Right now, I'm reading Quantum Computing and Information theory with a small group and am in charge of leading our weekly-ish discussions and making guided worksheets which you can find <a href="/math/quantum-computing">on my quantumn computing page</a>, though they are all tailored to the group and meant to be discussed alongside being worked on, so they might not be immediately helpful for everyone.

    In the past, I worked for University of Michigan's <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/math-corps/">Math Corps</a> program for 2 years as a summer camp counselor, and did a few months of their Math Circle program as well. I highly encourage you to visit their website and donate to keep the program going, since it helps local kids learn more math and have fun each summer and during the school year at not cost to their families.

    I also ran a monthly math game night at the University of Michigan for a year while I was there.
